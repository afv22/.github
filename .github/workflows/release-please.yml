# Reusable Release Please workflow
# Call from other repos:
#   uses: afv22-projects/.github/.github/workflows/release-please.yml@main
#   with:
#     release-type: python
#   secrets: inherit
#
# For manifest-based configuration (using release-please-config.json and
# .release-please-manifest.json in the calling repo), omit release-type:
#   uses: afv22-projects/.github/.github/workflows/release-please.yml@main
#   secrets: inherit
#
# For monorepos with package in a subdirectory:
#   uses: afv22-projects/.github/.github/workflows/release-please.yml@main
#   with:
#     release-type: node
#     path: client
#   secrets: inherit
